			<h3>What is <span>Smart Digital Media?</span></h3>
			<p>
				Digital media typically means two things for marketers:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Lost potential when it comes to learning about your intended audience</li>
				<li>A computer-led approach that leaves your well-crafted messaging in tatters</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Why a people-based approach is best</h3>
			<p>
				We approach our media planning and buying with the same people-first approach we use with everything else. This helps us cut through the noise and learn about <em>the people</em> in your audience, and means we are able to leverage the power behind advanced digital media buying algorithms to ensure they are optimizing towards exactly what you need: people.
